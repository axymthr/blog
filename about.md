This is a personal blog built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Jekyll is a static site generator that's perfect for blogs. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the site's look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.
