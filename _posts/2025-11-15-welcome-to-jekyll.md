Welcome to my new Jekyll blog hosted on GitHub Pages!

## Getting Started with Jekyll

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.

### Key Features

- **Simple**: No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install—just your content.
- **Static**: Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in. Static sites come out ready for deployment.
- **Blog-aware**: Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.

### How to Add Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

### Code Snippets

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
